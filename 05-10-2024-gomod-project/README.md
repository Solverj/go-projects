# Introduction  
## What
* We're going to setup a, from scrach, go project using go mod
* Then we're going to make a simple http server
* And Run the go program
* Then finally curl it
## How
* We're going to skip all the concepts and just quickly follow a pattern, I know you like learning by doing as much as I do. 
## Why
* I want you to be the elite analytical hackers you know you are. Stop deploying single spring boot apps taking hundreds of megs of disk and ram, and open up your eyes to small below 10 megabyte binaries instead with a startup time below a second. I want you to feel as powerful and in control as I felt when going from Kotlin to Go.
## After coding
* hit the like and subscribe so I know that you.... hated it...
* I'm planning that this will be part of a series, where I'll run through enough go code to make you itch to play around with it yourself.
* The code that we made together, will be in the description below. There's also a cool readme template called auto-template you might want to use for creating README.md's.
* Next time we'll make a HTTP client and do some HTTP calls, maybe to our own server which we made today.
